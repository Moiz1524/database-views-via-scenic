## What are Database Views?

Database views can be very helpful in scaling a large Ruby on Rails application. The main purpose of a database view is to provide a way to query data from multiple tables in a simplified manner, essentially creating a virtual table that combines data from multiple tables. By using a view, you can simplify complex SQL queries that require joining several tables together, making your code more readable and easier to maintain.

One of the main benefits of using database views is improved performance. When you have complex queries that involve multiple tables, it can be very time-consuming to join all of the tables together each time the query is executed. By creating a view that encapsulates the join, you can simplify your queries and avoid the overhead of repeated joins.

In addition to improved performance, database views can also help to improve data security. Views can be used to restrict access to sensitive data, providing an additional layer of protection against unauthorized access. For example, you might create a view that exposes only a subset of data from a larger table, or that aggregates data in a way that prevents users from accessing individual records.

Overall, the use of database views can greatly improve the scalability and performance of a large Ruby on Rails application. By simplifying complex SQL queries and providing a layer of security, views can help to ensure that your application can handle large amounts of data while remaining responsive and secure
